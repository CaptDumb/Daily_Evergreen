                          <h2>Darryl Monroe</h2>
                         	 <br></br>
		    		<p>It’s a hot and sunny day with a no clouds in sight in Pullman, and redshirt junior linebacker Darryl Monroe is getting ready for practice to start. He stands at 6’1”, 235 pounds, a player who has ability to shed the block of a defensive lineman and lay a huge hit on a quarterback or prevent a running back from gaining yardage.</p>

<p>Monroe finished third on the team in tackles last season with 94 and if the Cougars are to make another run at a bowl game this season he’ll have to increase those numbers given the amount of depth the Cougars have lost on the defensive side for this season.</p>

<p>After running through their routine warm up drills in practice on the Rogers Practice Field, Monroe, wearing a gray helmet, white practice jersey and full pads, gathers the defense. Standing in the middle of the huddle, Monroe talks about what the game plan is for the defense for day and then breaks off with a special saying.</p>

<p>“One time for the one time, say it like you mean it, we all we got, we all we need,” Monroe said.</p>

<p>According to the middle linebacker, the chant originated during the middle of last season, when the Cougars were facing adversity.</p>

<p>“It was just a sort of thing where we felt like if you weren’t a Cougar, everyone was against us,” Monroe said. “It was just like a heated practice and I was just talking to guys like ‘man we don’t need anyone else, we all we got’.”</p>

<p>WSU junior linebacker Kache Palacio picked up on the saying and fired back to Monroe with the saying, “we all we need.”</p>

<p>“From there we was like that’s what we break on because that’s what we honestly believe,” Monroe said. “The only thing we need here is our players and our coaching staff and we can take on the world.”</p>

<p>Make no doubt about it Monroe is the leader for the Washington State Cougars. Last season he was voted team captain ten times for the Cougars.</p>

<p>“Our MIKE linebacker’s got to be our leader, and the DB’s (defensive backs) rally around that position, our d-line rally around that position and that’s part of it,” WSU Defensive Coordinator Mike Breske said.</p>

<p>The redshirt junior will be entering his third season as the Cougars starting middle linebacker and embraces the role as leader for the Cougars on defense.</p>

<p>“You always got the chance to go out and better yourself because if you aren’t getting better than you’re making everybody else worse because they are always following you,” Monroe said. “The younger guys look up to you. People don’t look at you like ‘oh this guy is irresponsible,’ they treat you like an adult.”</p>

<p>Monroe claims being the leader of the WSU football defense is his biggest leadership role, however he’s shown signs of leadership during his playing days at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Fla.</p>

<p>Monroe’s linebacker coach Ken Jones said he never had to yell at his linebacker group when Monroe was at Dr. Phillips because the WSU linebacker already took initiative and pulled the group to the side of the field in order to get the group focused.</p>

<p>“He basically was my teacher on the field,” Coach Jones said.</p>

<p>Monroe became a standout player at Dr. Phillips High School and during his senior year he helped the school achieve their best season in the program’s history. The Panthers finished the 2010 season with a 14-1 record and an appearance in the 6A Florida State Championship game.</p>

<p>“I honestly felt like we had a team that should’ve had like a documentary or a TV show,” Monroe said. “There’s lots of times that I’m still here to this day that I’ll reminisce or go back and watch old YouTube videos of high school or just call up my buddies and just reminisce about the old times. It was honestly the best years of my life including these (years with WSU).”

Monroe has tweeted pictures of a sacred wall at Dr. Phillips High School that holds pictures of all the athletes who have gone on to play collegiate football and the pros. Green Bay Packers free safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix played at Dr. Phillips High School with Monroe is 2010 and became the No.1 safety in the country for the 2010 recruiting class, according to scout.com. Monroe has a photo of himself on the wall due to the success he’s accomplished at Dr. Phillips High School, however his goal is to have a photo of himself in an NFL uniform.

“We have a lot of guys who just really pushing to level up Dr. Phillips and just going back when I work out to see all the acolytes and pictures those guys really take pride in it, they follow me with everything I do, they constantly text me .” Monroe said. “So when I go home and see the pictures of other players below me, after me as far as me graduating like with their doing is just a sense of pride.”

Monroe said he’s still in frequent contact with his former high school coaching staff. Dr. Phillips High School Running Backs Coach Riki Smith is one of those coaches who have had an impact on Monroe.

“Ray-Ray,” was Monroe’s nickname in high school, according to Smith.

“He was like the heartbeat man,” Smith said. “He was the one in the locker room, talking junk, the one getting hyped. You could just tell he loved football. He’s so passionate, just a great kid, great practice player, comes from a great family, just an awesome kid man.”</p>

<p>Smith noticed Monroe’s potential as a football player when the Panthers faced off against Edgewater High School where Monroe laid such a big hit on the Edgewater running back that his (Monroe’s) helmet popped off.</p>

<p>“He slammed the kid and he (Monroe) got up and he started high stepping towards the sideline, shaking his head,” Smith said. “From that point I look at Coach Wells (Dr. Phillips Football Head Coach at the time) and I said ‘hey we got something here’.”</p>

<p>The Dr. Phillips running back coach said the school has a picture of Monroe signature tackle which is signed by the WSU middle linebacker.</p>

<p>Monroe was named to the Central Florida All-Defensive Team by the Orlando Sentinel in his senior year at Dr. Phillips High School. He was labeled as a two-star recruit and ranked the No.66 best outside linebacker in the 2010 recruiting class, according to scout.com. The Dr. Phillips outside linebacker held offers from South Florida, Middle Tennessee, and Louisiana-Lafayette which were schools near his home Orlando. However Monroe decided to dawn crimson and gray and play football at school that was 2,315 miles away from Orlando.</p>

<p>Monroe said when he got the offer from Washington State he was unfamiliar with the Pac-12 and WSU, however former Washington State Co-Defensive Coordinator Chris Ball encouraged Monroe to take a visit to WSU and also offered Monroe a scholarship.</p>

<p>“Before I took a visit, he (Ball) called me multiple times a week and the last question he would ask me was about football,” Monroe said. “He was really in my personal life and then when I came up here, everyone treated me like family. Everyone was just so friendly, it felt like a home away from home.”</p>

<p>After making two trips to Pullman before officially signing with the Cougars, Monroe was ready to become a Cougar.</p>

<p>When Ball left to take the Co-Defensive Coordinator position at Arizona State, Monroe said he was heart-broken. Monroe was on the verge of transferring out of WSU once the new football coaching staff was hired in December of 2011. However Monroe decided to continue his football career in Pullman.</p>

<p>“I just listened to my folks, and I prayed on it and everyone told me to just stay and just tough it out and get over your injury and just try and get back on the field and see how it goes,” Monroe said.</p>

<p>After suffering from a season ending torn Achilles during his first year with the Cougars in 2011 and adjusting to a new coaching staff, things have been moving upward for Monroe with his football career in Pullman.</p>

<p>Coming off of their first bowl game appearance since the 2003 which Monroe played a vital role in, expectations for the WSU football team are beginning to rise. However Monroe wants to take one week at a time.</p>

<p>“Just live in that moment, win that game celebrate with my boys and after that Sunday, win another one,” Monroe said. “I just want to look at it as if ‘just win this game, you have one game for the rest of your life, win it.’”</p>

<p>Once Monroe leaves WSU he plans to play football for as long as he can and then focus on broadcast production.</p>

<p>“He’s going to make it,” Smith said. “He just has that work ethic that you can’t coach, you can’t teach. Some players are talented but they don’t know how to work. Where you can get the guy that’s not as talented, but has great work ethic and he’s a baller. But if you find those kind with great talent and great work ethic, then you got a special player like Ha Ha (Clinton-Dix). I think “Ray-Ray” can get there too.”</p>

                            <h2>Ernie Kent</h2>
                         
		    		<p>Although Ernie Kent was hired to take over the ranks as the new WSU men’s basketball head coach and lead to the Cougars to the postseason, there’s another side to Coach Kent. Even though his love and knowledge for the game is of basketball is at an incredible high, Evergreen reporter Evan Baron had a chance to sit down with Coach Kent and focus on topics that were not related to his game plan for this upcoming season or player updates. Instead Coach Kent got the opportunity to answer a variety of interesting topics.

<p>The Daily Evergreen: Have you done the ice bucket challenge yet?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: (Laughs) That’s a good question, I did the challenge at camp, it wasn’t the ice bucket challenge, it was a cold water challenge it was called then. I got 100 hundred cups of water dumped everywhere on my body. I think the ice bucket challenge would’ve been a little easier than the 100 hundred cups of cold water by nine, ten, eleven and thirteen year-old kids. They got a little creative in their dumping of the water.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: Who do you think you would challenge?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: Even after my cold water challenge, the person I challenged was Lorenzo Romar of the University of Washington. The Cougars and the Huskies have a rivalry anyhow, and I wanted to see if he could outdo me and go to 200 hundred cups of water.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: Has Romar done it yet?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: I don’t know if he has or not.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: Besides coaching basketball, what activities have you participated in Pullman so far?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: I’ve had a chance to do to a lot of walking, I’m an avid walker, and biking, which I love to do. They have some wonderful trails here. The trail from Pullman to Moscow, I tackled that one Saturday morning and just riding around this city. This is a pretty unique and special place that I think is a hidden gym here and it’s given me an opportunity to really get to know it by bike and by foot which has been wonderful.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: What are some great restaurant’s you’ve had a chance to eat at here in Pullman?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: Well everyone knows about The Black Cypress, that’s my favorite I probably say to eat at.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: I saw on twitter you took a visit to The Coug, how was that experience and did you sign the wall?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: I think I may have signed the wall. My first visit to The Coug, you know I heard about it for so many years and got some good friends that went to school here and they told me when I got the job, ‘you have to go to The Coug.’ So I did it for two reasons, number one I wanted to go where the students, a good number of them up there on College Hill would hang out, but then number two I also sent out a nice shout out to all those former Cougar friends of mine who have spent some times at The Coug.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: How did the students react when you walked into The Coug?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: (Laughs) I think they were surprised to see me there, and I just thought it was a great place in terms of tradition. You can just feel the tradition walking in the door, the history that’s taken place there, and I’m sure though I in no way put any kind of dent in terms of the reputation of anybody in the number of beers they down in being in The Coug, because that’s just not me.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: How would you say Pullman compares to Eugene, Ore.?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: I think they’re similar in a lot of ways. They’re both college communities, when the students are away, both cities tend to really quite down and obviously they’re wonderful places to leave and maneuver and get around and then when the students return all of that energy comes back into both cities because you can just feel it right now.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: When you return to Eugene this upcoming season, how do you think the Oregon fans will react when you are introduced?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: I think it will be very warm response because my time at Oregon was not only there as a coach but as a player as well, and a lot of Oregon’s success you were a part of as a player, or as a coach, and I have fond memories there. I went to school there, my kids went to school there and so there’s a lot of history and a lot of tradition that’s there, but make no mistake I coach the Cougs now and I need to have a team that’s ready for that environment when we get back there.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: How was the Dick Vitale Honoring Ceremony over the summer that you went to?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: That was a wonderful ceremony, being still a past present of the board of directors, having so many great friends in college basketball with Dick being one of those people. It was nice to get back there and honor him. It’s a wonderful chance for the National Association of Basketball Coaches, our foundation to honor the man of the year. So to get back there and honor Dick was an excellent opportunity. He’s done a lot for the game of college basketball.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: Is it likely or unlikely you and Coach Calapari can work out a deal to get a Kentucky vs WSU matchup in Pullman sometime soon?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: I have a lot of friends on the board and I’ve always said that I would play anyone. I will go anywhere and that could be (against) Cal at Kentucky, Mike (Krzyzewski) at Duke, Roy (Williams) at North Carolina, (Jim) Boeheim at Syracuse. I will go back to their places, but they have to return the trip and come in here in Pullman and play. I continue to finagle requests, get after, do what I can do to try and range something of that magnitude and that would be neat to bring that type of caliber team in here, although there’s just as good as caliber teams in this conference that are going to be coming into Beasley too. And I’m going to say this and be very sincere, with that we’re going to build a basketball team that is a reflection of this community, and that’s a hard working team that gives you an honest day’s work for an honest dollar. But at the same time if any type of success we’re going to have this year, the students are going to play a great role. We need them in that building and I’m hoping they’ll look at Beasley as they’re club, they’re night on the town and go and make that place as crazy and as wild as they want to be. Just go have a party in Beasley and by the way we’re going to hope to entertain them at the party.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: Who’s the best basketball player you’ve had to matchup against when you were a player?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: Boy as a player I would have to say Marques Johnson, because I thought he had an ability that he had a tremendous perimeter game that he could really shoot the basketball. But he had a power game also that if he got you with anything inside of five, six feet he could elevate and dunk over you. So you really had to pay attention to detail when you played against him because if you slept on him he would make you pay for it.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: Who’s the best basketball player you’ve had a chance to coach?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: There’s been some great players I have coached and I would have to pick those three guys are getting ready to be inducted into the Oregon Hall of Fame, and that’s Luke Ridnour, Luke Jackson and Freddy Jones. And when you have a group that goes No.14 in the (NBA) draft, and No. 10 in the (NBA) draft, I think at the time only Duke and Oregon put three straight players in the first round of the (NBA) draft like that. So those guys are pretty special to me to have the chance to coach them, and of course you coach Carmelo (Anthony) of USA Basketball, Deron Williams, Andre Iguodala, Chris Bosh players of that magnitude but that was like over a ten day-two week period. When you talk about Luke, Luke and Freddy and having them around for three and four years and having the opportunity to coach that type of talent and guys, that have that type of leadership and ability to elevate your program that was pretty special.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: What was the best part about working with the Pac-12 Networks?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: The biggest thing was just having an opportunity to go in and out of every program in this conference and see coaches up close and personal with their day of the game prep and things like that, and understanding that again, and more so reinforcing that you are on the right page, you did things correctly. You watch other coaches teach and they put their emphasis on the academics and the character piece off the floor. To see coaches and how they teach in practice, I don’t think coaches have gotten enough credit. They are educators and they are teachers and when you’ve had a chance to go around and see all of these programs, I wanted to see if they cared as much about kids as I did off the floor and academics success and they do and yet at the same time I thought there were some outstanding coaches in this conference as well too.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: If you had a chance to play one-on-one with any player in any generation, who would it be?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: For me I think I would say Oscar Robertson, because anybody that can average a triple-double for their career, you would want to know what their skill set is that allowed them to do that. Obviously Jordan, and Kobe and LeBron, those are phenomenal players, and Jabbar and Chamberlain and Larry Bird had tremendous size, but to average a triple-double that takes an enormous amount of skill and intelligence and fortitude and that would be the player that I would want to see, just to be in his presence, to see the type of command presence he has on the floor as a basketball player.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: Do you think you can still get out there and run on the court with your guys?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: No, I know I can’t I don’t even want to try and do that. So my job is to coach them and get them to run faster and run faster and even run faster, because we play with so much speed, but to think I could get out there on the floor and run with today’s athlete, there’s absolutely no way I would even allow myself to think that.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: If you were on an island, assuming you had food and shelter what three things would you take with you?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: (Laughs) If they have Wi-Fi over there I’m taking my computer so I can keep up with the Cougs. If I’m going to go I’m going to know what the Cougs are doing. Number two, I would definitely want to have a means on that computer to stay connected to CNN because I love world news. Having spent my time overseas in Saudi Arabia I always like to keep a pulse on what’s going on around the world. Number three, I would definitely have to take my bible with me.</p>

<p>The Daily Evergreen: What are looking forward to the most about your first season as the WSU men’s basketball head coach?</p>

<p>Ernie Kent: You know when I had the opportunity to coach players, the likes of Aaron Brooks, and his charisma and what he brought to the table every day in practice. Bryce Taylor--I’ll never forget what that team instilled in me, and Bryce Taylor said it well at the senior banquet. He talked to the younger players, the underclassmen, and he taught me something too when he stood up and said ‘make sure you embrace the process because it goes so quickly, and I don’t care if it’s adversity, success, it’s a down moment, it’s an up moment, you need to embrace that because that’s all part of your growth process to getting to be champions one day.’ And I think that’s the one thing, young people they want to get their so quickly, fans they want to get there so quickly, that they missed the very own essence of this game. What we do as coaches, that’s to teach and take people from one level to the next level that is a process, and I’m requesting the student body and this community to come out and embrace that process. Be a part of the journey along the way, they will appreciate the success that much more once we get there.</p>
