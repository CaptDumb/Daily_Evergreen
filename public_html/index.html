		    		<p>It’s a hot, sunny day in Pullman, and redshirt junior linebacker Darryl Monroe is getting ready for practice to start. He stands at 6’1”, 235 pounds—a player who has ability to shed the block of a defensive lineman and lay a huge hit on a quarterback.</p>

<p>After running through their routine warm up drills in practice on the Rogers Practice Field, Monroe, wearing a gray helmet, white practice jersey and full pads, gathers the defense. Standing in the middle of the huddle, Monroe talks about what the game plan is for the defense for day and then breaks off with a special saying.</p>

<p>“One time for the one time, say it like you mean it, we all we got, we all we need,” Monroe said.</p>

<p>The middle linebacker said the chant originated during the middle of last season, when the Cougars were facing adversity.</p>

<p>“It was just a sort of thing where we felt like if you weren’t a Cougar, everyone was against us,” Monroe said. “It was just like a heated practice and I was just talking to guys like ‘man we don’t need anyone else, we all we got’.”</p>

<p>WSU junior linebacker Kache Palacio picked up on the saying and responded with the saying, “we all we need.”</p>

<p>“From there we was like that’s what we break on because that’s what we honestly believe,” Monroe said. “The only thing we need here is our players and our coaching staff and we can take on the world.”</p>

<br></br>

<br></br>

<p>No doubt about it, Monroe is the leader for the Washington State Cougars. Last season he was voted team captain ten times for the Cougars.</p>

<p>Monroe finished third tackles for the team last season with 94, and if the Cougars are to make another run at a bowl game this season he’ll have to increase those numbers given the amount of depth the Cougars have lost on the defensive side for this season.</p>

<p>“Our MIKE linebacker’s got to be our leader, and the DB’s (defensive backs) rally around that position, our d-line rally around that position and that’s part of it,” WSU Defensive Coordinator Mike Breske said.</p>

<p>The redshirt junior will be entering his third season as the Cougars’ starting middle linebacker, and embraces the role as leader for the Cougars on defense.</p>

<p>“You always got the chance to go out and better yourself, because if you aren’t getting better then you’re making everybody else worse because they are always following you,” Monroe said. “The younger guys look up to you.”</p>

<p>Monroe claims being the leader of the WSU football defense is his biggest leadership role, however he’s shown signs of leadership during his playing days at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Fla.</p>

<p>Monroe’s linebacker coach Ken Jones said he never had to yell at his linebacker group when Monroe was at Dr. Phillips, thanks in part to Monroe’s leadership.</p>

<p>Monroe became a standout player at Dr. Phillips High School. During his senior year, in 2010,  he helped the school achieve their best season in the program’s history, appearing in the 6A Florida State Championship game.</p>

<p>Monroe has tweeted pictures of a sacred wall at Dr. Phillips High School that holds pictures of athletes who have gone on to play professional and collegiate football. Green Bay Packers free safety HaHa Clinton-Dix is among them. While Monroe holds a spot on the wall thanks to his time at WSU his goal to land among the other NFL names.</p>

<p>Monroe keeps in frequent contact with his former high school coaching staff. Dr. Phillips High School Running Backs Coach Riki Smith is one of the coaches who Monroe said had a major impact on his life. “Ray-Ray,” was Monroe’s nickname in high school, Smith said.</p>

<p>“He was like the heartbeat man,” Smith said. “He was the one in the locker room, talking junk, the one getting hyped. You could just tell he loved football. He’s so passionate, just a great kid, great practice player.”</p>

<p>Monroe was named to the Central Florida All-Defensive Team by the Orlando Sentinel in his senior year at Dr. Phillips High School. He was labeled as a two-star recruit and ranked the No.66 best outside linebacker in the 2010 recruiting class, according to scout.com. The Dr. Phillips outside linebacker held offers from South Florida, Middle Tennessee, and Louisiana-Lafayette, schools not far from his hometown, Orlando. But Monroe decided to don crimson and gray and play football at school 2,315 miles away.</p>

<p>When he got the offer from Washington State he was unfamiliar with the Pac-12 and WSU. However, former Washington State Co-Defensive Coordinator Chris Ball encouraged Monroe to visit WSU. He recruited Monroe tirelessly, and offered him a scholarship.</p>

<p> “He was really in my personal life and then when I came up here, everyone treated me like family. Everyone was just so friendly; it felt like a home away from home,” Monroe said.</p>

 <p>Monroe made two trips to Pullman before officially signing with the WSU football team.</p>


<p>After suffering from a season-ending torn Achilles during his first year with the Cougars in 2011 and adjusting to a new coaching staff, things have been moving upward for Monroe with his football career in Pullman.</p>

<p>“He slammed the kid and he (Monroe) got up and he started high stepping towards the sideline, shaking his head,” Smith said. “From that point I look at Coach Wells (Dr. Phillips Football Head Coach at the time) and I said ‘hey we got something here’.”</p>

<p>Coming off of their first bowl game appearance since the 2003, expectations for the WSU football team are beginning to rise. But Monroe wants to take one week at a time.</p>


<p>“Just live in that moment, win that game, celebrate with my boys, and after that Sunday, win another one,” Monroe said. “I just want to look at it as if ‘just win this game, you have one game for the rest of your life, win it.’”</p>

<p>Once Monroe leaves WSU he plans to play football for as long as he can and then focus on broadcast production.</p>

<p>“He’s going to make it,” Smith said. “He just has that work ethic that you can’t coach, you can’t teach. Some players are talented but they don’t know how to work. Where you can get the guy that’s not as talented, but has great work ethic and he’s a baller. But if you find those kind with great talent and great work ethic, then you got a special player like HaHa (Clinton-Dix). I think “Ray-Ray” can get there too.”</p>

                            <h2>More than just a coach; Kent off the court</h2>
                            
		    		<p>Although Ernie Kent was hired to take over as the new WSU men’s basketball head coach and lead to the Cougars to the postseason, there’s another side to Coach Kent. Even though his love and knowledge for the game is of basketball is incredibly deep, The Daily Evergreen had a chance to sit down with Kent and focus on topics that were not related to his game plan for this upcoming season or player updates.</p>

<br></br>

<p><b>The Daily Evergreen: Have you done the ice bucket challenge yet?</b><p>

<p>EK: That’s a good question. I did the challenge at camp - it wasn’t the ice bucket challenge, though, it was called a cold water challenge then. I got 100 hundred cups of water dumped everywhere on my body. I think the ice bucket challenge would’ve been a little easier than the 100 hundred cups of cold water by nine, ten, eleven and thirteen year-old kids.</p>

<br></br>

<p><b>DE: Besides coaching basketball, what activities have you participated in Pullman so far?</b></p>

<p>EK: I’ve had a chance to do to a lot of walking, I’m an avid walker, and biking, which I love to do. They have some wonderful trails here. The trail from Pullman to Moscow, I tackled that one Saturday morning and just riding around this city. This is a pretty unique and special place that I think is a hidden gym here and it’s given me an opportunity to really get to know it by bike and by foot which has been wonderful.</p>

<br></br>

<p><b>DE: How would you say Pullman compares to Eugene, Ore.?</b></p>

<p>EK: T they’re similar in a lot of ways. They’re both college communities - when the students are away, both cities tend to really quiet down and then when the students return all of that energy comes back into both cities. You can feel it right now.<p>

<br></br>

<p><b>DE: Is it likely or unlikely you and Coach Calapari can work out a deal to get a Kentucky vs WSU matchup in Pullman sometime soon?</b></p>

<p>EK: I have a lot of friends on the board and I’ve always said that I would play anyone. I will go anywhere and that could be Cal at Kentucky, Mike (Krzyzewski) at Duke, Roy (Williams) at North Carolina, (Jim) Boeheim at Syracuse. I’ll go back to their places, but they have to return the trip and come in here in Pullman and play.</p>

<p>And I’m going to say this and be very sincere. We’re going to build a basketball team that is a reflection of this community, and that’s a hard working team that gives you an honest day’s work for an honest dollar. For any type of success we’re going to have this year, the students are going to play a great role. We need them in that building and I’m hoping they’ll look at Beasley as their club, their night on the town, and make that place as crazy and as wild as they want to be.</p>

<br></br>

<p><b>DE: Who’s the best basketball player you’ve had to matchup against when you were a player?</b></p>

<p>EK: Boy, as a player I would have to say Marques Johnson, because he had a tremendous perimeter game and he could really shoot the basketball. But he had a power game also that if he got you with anything inside of five, six feet he could elevate and dunk over you. So you really had to pay attention to detail when you played against him.</p>

<br></br>

<p><b>DE: If you had a chance to play one-on-one with any player in any generation, who would it be?</b></p>

<p>EK: Oscar Robertson, because anybody that can average a triple-double for their career, you would want to know what their skill set is that allowed them to do that. To average a triple-double… that takes an enormous amount of skill and intelligence and fortitude, and that would be the player that I would want to see.</p>

<br></br>

<p><b>DE: What are looking forward to the most about your first season as the WSU men’s basketball head coach?</b></p>

<p>EK: When I had the opportunity to coach players, like Aaron Brooks, Bryce Taylor--I’ll never forget what that team instilled in me, and Bryce Taylor said it well at the senior banquet. He talked to the younger players, the underclassmen, and he taught me something too when he stood up and said, “make sure you embrace the process because it goes so quickly, and I don’t care if it’s adversity, success, it’s a down moment, it’s an up moment. You need to embrace that because that’s all part of your growth process to getting to be champions one day.”</p>

<p>And I think young people want to get there so quickly, fans want to get there so quickly, that they missed the essence of this game. What we do as coaches, we teach and take people from one level to the next level. That is a process, and I’m requesting the student body and this community to come out and embrace that process. Be a part of the journey along the way, they will appreciate the success that much more once we get there.</p>
